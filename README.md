# Medusa

![test status](https://github.com/adcox/medusa/actions/workflows/python-tests.yml/badge.svg)

A Python toolkit to explore multi-body dynamical systems such as the circular 
restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) and the CR3BP with low-thrust forces.

This software is the next evolution of the [Astrohelion](https://github.com/adcox/astrohelion)
C++ tool which supports the same types of dynamical systems analyses.
