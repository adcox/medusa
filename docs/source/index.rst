Etymology
---------

In Greek mythology, Medusa is generally described as a woman with living snakes 
for hair. As this *python* (snakes) library supports *multi-body* (many snakes?)
analysis, the name "medusa" is somewhat relevant. Don't read too far into the 
metaphor, though; we promise the code won't turn your computer into stone.
